    <p>
        It is no surprise that technology has become an inevitable part of life. In this astonishing pace of digitization in the current scenario, tech is a part of our new lifestyle.

From something as simple as online classes to building our own business or even just finding a partner, the things we do online could make a long list. As of 2022, 64% of the global population were active internet users(Statista). With the rise of its use in day to day lives, it is ready to be a bigger part of our lifestyle serving both positives or negatives.

The use of technology has become like a global race, with everyone owning up to their businesses and/or innovations with a slightly desperate hope to be the first one on the rank. The use of tech primarily is to innovate tools that the masses will definitely love. As we become more and more tech dependent, we are also moving close to a world where social interaction is completely digital; which could be a huge downfall. 
But here lets come to a conclusion by talking about the positives and negatives now, shall we?

    <h2 class = "bold">The Positives</h2>
    <p>
        The number of internet users has been increasing drastically like never before. The number of active internet users accounts to 64% of the global population as of 2023. With that being 6% in the year 2000, we can already estimate how the number of internet users has spiked. Estimated 500,000 people join the internet everyday, according to the same survey. (Statista)
Seeing ourselves as an audience throughout the years of development, we couldn’t have imagined being so tech dependent.
Some good impacts it has had can be:

        <h3 class = "bold">Instant Communication</h3>
    <p>
        From the old days of waiting at least a few days to get a letter, to being just a click away from messaging our loved ones; interaction has been made so much easier with the help of technology. It has broken down the barriers that distance once created. Applications like Zoom, Skype and FaceTime have went on a step further to provide the experience of video calling, wherein we get to see and talk real time with people from any corner of the world. Even during the coronavirus outbreak, these applications were used more than 2 billion times; meaning it has really helped us.

    <div class = "cyan_blue box">
        <h3 class = "bold">Globalization</h3>
    <p>
        Technology has brought us closer than ever, making the world a global village. Inside a small gaming community or a small sub reddit, we can form a group of people bonding without considering the physical barriers they have. Introverts can make new friends, we can find our life partner or simply a socially anxious person can remotely communicate with people instead of face to face.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "cyan_blue box">
        <h3 class = "bold">Access to information</h3>
    <p>
        An ocean of knowledge, the internet has been a relay for many informative searches out there. An estimation of over 6.3 million searches are conducted per minute on google. With the rising use of smartphones and easy to use devices, we can access any information we want from the devices on our fingertips.

    </div>
    <div class = "cyan_blue box">
        <h3 class = "bold">Simplified tasks</h3>
    <p>
        Technology has simplified the complex of tasks. In the recent days, with the development of artificial intelligence, simplifying tasks has been much easier. One example can be ChatGPT. The use of online shopping using many applications that provide services and products to our doorsteps and the use of online platform to get a job can also be good examples.

    <div class = "cyan_blue box">
        <h3 class = "bold">Entertainment</h3>
    <p>
        Millions of content posted daily on youtube, tiktok, reddit, and many other social media apps prove that entertainment is highly demanded nowadays. With smartphones and laptop connected to the internet, content is just a few clicks away. Entertainment has become one of the main sources of entertainment in the 21st century.

        <b>THE NEGATIVES</b>
    </h2>
    <div class = "cyan_blue box">
        <h3 class = "bold">Decreased Human Contact</h3>
    <p>
        Though we could conclude that the internet is bringing us closer, at the same time it is also decreasing human contact. It is obvious that we have seen people around us ignoring their loved ones for the sake of more screen time; whether it be social media or simply gaming.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "cyan_blue box">
        <h3 class = "bold">Rise in bullying</h3>
    <p>
        There are all sorts of people in the internet. And since internet can be a huge community, we don’t each and every person behind the screen. The use of internet and the rise in cyberbullying goes hand by hand. Whether it be stalking or just simply breaching one’s privacy, we have heard of many instances in which we understand this downfall in this day.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "cyan_blue box">
        <h3 class = "bold">Online Deceptors</h3>
    <p>
        The term catfish has been increasingly used nowadays due to a reason. Online dating apps or simply even just a marketing scam, online deception has become spiked in today’s day and age. Worst case scenarios have been people even getting kidanpped or killed in dark web for the sake of money. It is truly dangerous out there.
    </p>
    </div>
    <img src = "images/Social media.png" width = "600" height = "400">
    <div class = "cyan_blue box">
        <h3 class = "bold">Addiction</h3>
    <p>
        Too much of anything is bad. Addiction is basically being too much obsessed with something, to the point that maybe you cant live without it. According to screentime reports, the average screentime has become more than 3 hours; which is something we all are guilty of. Nowadays, it has become more than 6 hours. This is an alarming addiction that is very difficult to overcome.
    </br>
    The above image shows us how the rise in addiction has taken place. Its not a coincidence that since 2012, the graph has gone up and it was also in 2012 that the rise in use of various social media apps and the use of technology had been skyrocketed.

        <h3 class = "bold">Impact of technology while selling camera equipment</h3>
    <p>

We have our own website here and we provide the facility of online shopping facility.

    <div class = "cyan_blue box">
        <h2 class = "bold">The Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        We could see this as a mixture both positives and negatives. It all comes down to the users; to use tech responsibly and with caution. There have been made laws which won’t be effective until we acknowledge our duties as an active internet user. It is also necessary to spread awareness to vulnerable groups using technology and/or educating people about their rights and duties. Internet can be a boon to humankind if we use it responsibly. Technology being more advanced in this day and age is a great advantage to us as well as a responsibility which we must fulfill. In our upcoming days, we can see more progress and we can also expect more harmful side of tech; that is if we continue being irresponsible.
